    <h1>Interactive Co-Design of Safe and Assured Autonomous Systems</h1>
    <p>Workshop at CPS-Week 2026 | Saint Malo, France</p>

    <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
    <p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS), including industrial manipulators, mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, and emerging humanoid platforms, are rapidly moving from controlled laboratory settings into high-stakes application domains such as manufacturing, construction, healthcare, and defense. In these environments, autonomous systems increasingly share physical workspaces with human operators and must coordinate with other autonomous agents and networked infrastructure. This tight coupling between computation, physical dynamics, and human activity makes safety, robustness, and assurance central concerns rather than afterthoughts. As deployment scales, failures can have significant human, economic, and societal consequences. Consequently, there is an urgent need for design processes that systematically capture and reconcile the requirements of diverse stakeholders, including regulators and government agencies, system developers and integrators, operators in the field, and end users. The workshop will focus on how to interactively elicit and formalize these stakeholder requirements in the design and verification of autonomous CPS.</p>
    <p>At the same time, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and related foundation models have opened new opportunities for interactive, multi-modal knowledge elicitation. These models can process and generate text, code, images, and increasingly video, making it possible to capture domain knowledge from stakeholders in forms that are more natural than traditional specification languages. Building on these capabilities, a growing body of work is beginning to explore how to interactively elicit system requirements, task descriptions, environment models, safety constraints, and test scenarios from human experts, and then translate them into formal or semi-formal artifacts that can be used in the design, analysis, and verification of autonomous CPS. This emerging line of research is highly relevant to CPS and IoT, where environment assumptions, safety envelopes, and task specifications must be both expressive enough for domain experts and precise enough for formal reasoning and rigorous testing.</p>
    <p>However, interactive co-design is not only a modeling or verification problem; it is fundamentally a human–computer interaction (HCI) problem as well. Naively querying users for exhaustive requirements or environment details can lead to cognitive overload, fatigue, and incomplete or inconsistent specifications, undermining the promise of interactive tools. Realizing the potential of LLM-driven and other interactive techniques requires carefully designed interfaces and interaction modalities—spanning text, speech, diagrams, simulations, and demonstrations—that are grounded in HCI principles and user studies. On the backend, these interfaces must be coupled with algorithms and representations that can parse and structure user inputs, detect gaps and inconsistencies, and decide when and how to ask follow-up questions in a way that is efficient and respectful of users’ time. Ultimately, the combined interface and backend must enable users to iteratively instruct, inspect, and correct the formalized domain knowledge in an interpretable manner. While the CPS communities have long studied specification, modeling, and verification, the shift toward interactive, human-in-the-loop co-design introduces new challenges and opportunities that demand closer integration with HCI and human factors perspectives.</p>
    <p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from CPS, IoT, autonomous systems, formal methods, HCI, and related communities to chart this emerging space of interactive co-design for safe and assured autonomous systems. We aim to introduce and highlight HCI-driven perspectives on the design of multi-modal interactive interfaces for requirements and environment elicitation, and to connect them with ongoing CPS work on modeling, analysis, and assurance. By creating a venue where researchers can present early-stage ideas, mature systems, case studies, and negative results, the workshop seeks to catalyze new collaborations, identify common benchmarks and open problems, and articulate a research agenda for interactive co-design that is grounded in real-world CPS and IoT deployments. In doing so, the workshop will help the CPS/IoT community move toward design processes in which safety, assurance, and stakeholder needs are continuously and interactively integrated throughout the life cycle of autonomous systems.</p>
